# FirstDjangoProject
This project was just a way for me to begin learning some of the basics of working with 
virtual environments and django. All code that was written was done so by following along 
with a series of videos linked here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEsfXFp6DpzTD1BD1aWNxS2Ep06vIkaeW.
My intention with this was to learn more about hwo to develop web applications so that I can begin
to create them on my own and, hopefully, work on them in a more professional setting in the future.

Unlike the code, all notes that have been written were done so by myself and are written in a way
that is meant to make things as clear as possible for myself with less of a focus on writing them
in a professional\formal tone. Within these I not only documented the process for creating a very 
basic project but have also tracked any errors that I have encountered and updated them with fixes
that worked for me so I can look back at them if I encounter the same error again rather than trying
to look over multiple web pages for some length of time before I find a solution that works.
